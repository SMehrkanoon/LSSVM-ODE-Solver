# LSSVM-ODE-Solver
This demo illustrates the application of "Least Squares Support Vector machines" for learning the solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Two examples are provided and the obtained results are compared with the exact solution.

Hint: In the LSSVM_ODE_Demo, in order to switch from Example (1) to Example (2), lines 80-91 and 110-112, should be uncommented.
